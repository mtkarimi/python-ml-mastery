# Day 3: Fractions and Decimals

## Brief Introduction
Today, we will dive into the world of fractions and decimals. These are two fundamental concepts in mathematics that are used extensively in computer science. Understanding how to work with fractions and decimals is crucial for solving complex problems.

## Learning Objective
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to perform operations with fractions and convert between fractions and decimals with ease.

## Task 1: Simplify Fractions and Find Common Denominators

### Simplifying Fractions
A fraction is a way of expressing a number that is a part of a whole. It consists of a numerator (the top number) and a denominator (the bottom number). Simplifying a fraction means reducing it to its lowest terms. 

For example, the fraction 8/12 can be simplified to 2/3. Here's how:

1. Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator. The GCD of 8 and 12 is 4.
2. Divide the numerator and the denominator by the GCD. 8 รท 4 = 2 and 12 รท 4 = 3.
3. The simplified fraction is 2/3.

### Finding Common Denominators
When adding or subtracting fractions, you need to have the same denominator, known as a common denominator. 

For example, to add 1/4 and 2/3, you need to find a common denominator:

1. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators. The LCM of 4 and 3 is 12.
2. Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the LCM as the denominator. 1/4 becomes 3/12 and 2/3 becomes 8/12.
3. Now you can add the fractions: 3/12 + 8/12 = 11/12.

## Task 2: Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide Fractions

### Adding and Subtracting Fractions
Once you have a common denominator, you can add or subtract the numerators:

- Addition: 3/12 + 8/12 = (3 + 8)/12 = 11/12.
- Subtraction: 8/12 - 3/12 = (8 - 3)/12 = 5/12.

### Multiplying and Dividing Fractions
Multiplying and dividing fractions is straightforward:

- Multiplication: To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators and the denominators. For example, (2/3) * (3/4) = (2 * 3)/(3 * 4) = 6/12 = 1/2.
- Division: To divide fractions, multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second. For example, (2/3) รท (3/4) = (2/3) * (4/3) = 8/9.

## Task 3: Convert Fractions to Decimals and Vice Versa

### Fractions to Decimals
To convert a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator. For example, 3/4 = 3 รท 4 = 0.75.

### Decimals to Fractions
To convert a decimal to a fraction:

1. Count the number of decimal places. For example, 0.75 has two decimal places.
2. Write the decimal as a fraction (0.75 = 75/100).
3. Simplify the fraction if possible (75/100 = 3/4).
