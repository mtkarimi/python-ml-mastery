# Day 9: Polynomials

## Brief Introduction

Polynomials are mathematical expressions involving a sum of powers in one or more variables multiplied by coefficients. They are used in a wide variety of areas in mathematics and computer science, including algebra, calculus, and number theory.

## Learning Objective

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to understand what polynomials are, classify them based on their degree and number of terms, and perform basic operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication with them.

## Task 1: Classify Polynomials Based on Their Degree and Number of Terms

A polynomial can be classified based on its degree and the number of terms it has.

- **Degree of a Polynomial**: The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. For example, in the polynomial `3x^2 + 2x + 1`, the degree is 2.

- **Number of Terms in a Polynomial**: A polynomial can also be classified based on the number of terms it has. For example, a polynomial with one term is called a monomial (e.g., `5x^3`), with two terms is called a binomial (e.g., `3x^2 + 1`), and with three terms is called a trinomial (e.g., `x^2 + 2x + 1`).

## Task 2: Perform Addition and Subtraction of Polynomials

To add or subtract polynomials, you combine like terms. Like terms are terms that have the same variable and exponent. Here's how you do it:

- **Addition of Polynomials**: To add polynomials, you simply add the like terms. For example, `(3x^2 + 2x + 1) + (x^2 + 2x + 3)` equals `4x^2 + 4x + 4`.

- **Subtraction of Polynomials**: To subtract polynomials, you subtract the like terms. For example, `(3x^2 + 2x + 1) - (x^2 + 2x + 3)` equals `2x^2 + 0x - 2`.

## Task 3: Multiply Polynomials

To multiply polynomials, you use the distributive property, which states that `a(b + c) = ab + ac`. Here's how you do it:

- **Multiplication of Polynomials**: To multiply polynomials, you multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combine like terms. For example, `(x + 1)(x - 1)` equals `x^2 - 1`.

That's it for today's lesson on polynomials. Practice these operations until you feel comfortable with them. In the next lesson, we'll learn about polynomial division and factoring.
