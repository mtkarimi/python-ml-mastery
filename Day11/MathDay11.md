# Day 11: Ratios and Proportions

## Brief Introduction
Ratios and proportions are fundamental concepts in mathematics that help us compare quantities and solve problems. They are used in various fields, including computer science, to analyze data, make predictions, and solve problems.

## Learning Objective
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to define and simplify ratios, solve proportion problems, and apply proportions to find unknown values in real-world problems.

## Task 1: Define and Simplify Ratios

### Definition
A ratio is a way to compare two or more quantities. It tells us how much of one thing there is compared to another. For example, if there are 3 apples and 2 oranges in a basket, the ratio of apples to oranges is 3:2.

### Simplifying Ratios
To simplify a ratio, we divide all the numbers in the ratio by their greatest common factor (GCF). For example, the ratio 6:8 can be simplified by dividing both numbers by their GCF, which is 2. So, 6:8 simplifies to 3:4.

## Task 2: Solve Proportion Problems

### Definition
A proportion is an equation that states that two ratios are equal. For example, if a recipe calls for 2 cups of flour for every 3 cups of sugar, and you want to double the recipe, the proportion would be 2/3 = 4/6.

### Solving Proportions
To solve a proportion, we use cross-multiplication. Multiply the top number of one ratio by the bottom number of the other ratio, and set it equal to the product of the other two numbers. For example, to solve the proportion 2/3 = x/6, we multiply 2 by 6 and 3 by x, and set them equal to each other: 2*6 = 3*x. Solving for x gives x = 4.

## Task 3: Apply Proportions to Find Unknown Values in Word Problems

Proportions are often used to solve word problems. For example, if a car travels 60 miles in 2 hours, how far will it travel in 5 hours? We can set up a proportion to solve this: 60/2 = x/5. Cross-multiplying and solving for x gives x = 150. So, the car will travel 150 miles in 5 hours.

Remember, the key to solving word problems is to carefully read the problem, identify the known and unknown quantities, set up a proportion, and solve for the unknown.
