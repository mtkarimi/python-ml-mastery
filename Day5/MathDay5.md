# Day 5: Equations and Inequalities

## Brief Introduction
Today, we will dive into the world of equations and inequalities. Equations are mathematical statements that assert the equality of two expressions. Inequalities, on the other hand, are statements that one quantity is less than or greater than another. 

## Learning Objective
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to solve one-step equations and simple inequalities. You will also learn about absolute value and how it applies to inequalities.

## Task 1: Solve One-Step Algebraic Equations

One-step equations are the simplest form of algebraic equations where you can find the value of the variable in a single step. 

For example, consider the equation `x + 5 = 10`. To solve for `x`, we need to isolate `x` on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting `5` from both sides of the equation:

```
x + 5 - 5 = 10 - 5
x = 5
```

So, the solution to the equation `x + 5 = 10` is `x = 5`.

## Task 2: Solve and Graph Simple Inequalities on a Number Line

Inequalities are like equations, but instead of finding an exact value, we find a range of values. 

For example, consider the inequality `x + 2 < 7`. To solve for `x`, we subtract `2` from both sides:

```
x + 2 - 2 < 7 - 2
x < 5
```

So, the solution to the inequality `x + 2 < 7` is `x < 5`. This means that `x` can be any number less than `5`.

To graph this inequality on a number line, we draw a circle at `5` and an arrow pointing to the left, indicating that `x` is less than `5`.

```

```

## Task 3: Understand and Apply the Concept of Absolute Value in Inequalities

The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, regardless of direction. It is always positive or zero. 

For example, the absolute value of `-3` and `3` is `3`, because both are `3` units away from `0`.

In inequalities, absolute value can be used to define ranges. For example, the inequality `|x| < 3` means that `x` is less than `3` and greater than `-3`. This can be written as `-3 < x < 3`.

To graph this inequality on a number line, we draw filled circles at `-3` and `3` and an arrow pointing between them, indicating that `x` is between `-3` and `3`.

```

```

That's it for today's lesson. Practice these concepts and try to solve different types of one-step equations and simple inequalities. Happy learning!
