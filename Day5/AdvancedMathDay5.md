# Day 5: Basics of Set Theory in Discrete Mathematics

## Brief Introduction
Set theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which are collections of objects. It is a fundamental part of discrete mathematics, a field of mathematics that deals with discrete objects.

## Learning Objective
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to understand basic set operations and their properties.

## Task 1: Learn about sets, subsets, unions, intersections, and complements

### Sets and Subsets
A **set** is a collection of distinct objects, known as elements or members. For example, the set of all positive integers is a set. A **subset** is a set whose elements are all members of another set. For example, the set of all positive even numbers is a subset of the set of all positive integers.

### Unions
The **union** of two sets A and B is a set that contains all the elements that are in A, or in B, or in both. It is denoted as A ∪ B.

### Intersections
The **intersection** of two sets A and B is a set that contains all the elements that are in both A and B. It is denoted as A ∩ B.

### Complements
The **complement** of a set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements that are not in A.

## Task 2: Understand the concept of power sets and Cartesian products

### Power Sets
The **power set** of a set A is the set of all subsets of A. It is denoted as P(A).

### Cartesian Products
The **Cartesian product** of two sets A and B, denoted as A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.

## Task 3: Practice solving problems involving set operations and Venn diagrams

A **Venn diagram** is a diagram that shows all possible logical relations between a finite collection of different sets. It is a useful tool for visualizing set operations and solving problems involving sets.

### Example Problem
Let A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {2, 3, 4}, and C = {3, 4, 5}. Find A ∪ B, A ∩ B, A', P(A), and A × C.

### Solution
- A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}
- A ∩ B = {2, 3}
- A' = {4, 5}
- P(A) = {∅, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}
- A × C = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)}

By practicing problems like this, you can become proficient in performing set operations and using Venn diagrams.
