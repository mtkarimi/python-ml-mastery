# Day 28: Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning with PyTorch

Privacy-preserving machine learning is a critical aspect of data science, especially in sensitive applications where data privacy is paramount. This tutorial will introduce you to the concept of differential privacy, a technique for privacy-preserving machine learning. We will also explore federated learning, a method for training machine learning models on decentralized data. Finally, we will delve into PyTorch's tools and libraries that support these privacy-preserving techniques.

## Task 1: Learn about Differential Privacy and its Importance

Differential privacy is a system for publicly sharing information about a dataset by describing the patterns of groups within the dataset while withholding information about individuals in the dataset. It is a promise made by a data holder to a data subject that you are not significantly affected, adversely or otherwise, by allowing your data to be used in any study or analysis.

In the context of machine learning, differential privacy is used to ensure that the output of a machine learning algorithm doesn't reveal sensitive information about its input. This is achieved by adding a carefully calibrated amount of random noise to the data or the algorithm's output.

```python
import torch

def add_noise(data, epsilon=1.0):
    """Add Laplacian noise for differential privacy."""
    beta = 1.0 / epsilon
    noise = torch.distributions.laplace.Laplace(0, beta)
    return data + noise.sample(data.shape)
```

## Task 2: Implement a Simple Federated Learning Example

Federated learning is a machine learning approach where a model is sent to where the data resides (e.g., a user's device), trained on that data, and all the learnings (not the data) are sent back to a central server where they are aggregated to improve the global model. This process is repeated with many users' devices, leading to a robust model that doesn't compromise user privacy.

Here's a simple example of federated learning using PyTorch:

```python
import torch
from torch import nn, optim

# A Toy Dataset
data = torch.tensor([[1.,1],[0,1],[1,0],[0,0]], requires_grad=True)
target = torch.tensor([[1.],[1],[0],[0]], requires_grad=True)

# A Toy Model
model = nn.Linear(2,1)

def train():
    # Training Logic
    opt = optim.SGD(params=model.parameters(),lr=0.1)
    for iter in range(20):

        # 1) erase previous gradients (if they exist)
        opt.zero_grad()

        # 2) make a prediction
        pred = model(data)

        # 3) calculate how much we missed
        loss = ((pred - target)**2).sum()

        # 4) figure out which weights caused us to miss
        loss.backward()

        # 5) change those weights
        opt.step()

        # 6) print our progress
        print(loss.data)

train()
```

## Task 3: Explore PyTorch Tools/Libraries for Privacy-Preserving Techniques

PyTorch provides several tools and libraries to support privacy-preserving machine learning. One of these is PySyft, a Python library for secure and private deep learning. PySyft extends PyTorch and other deep learning tools with the cryptographic and distributed technologies necessary to safely and securely train AI models on sensitive data.

To install PySyft, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install syft
```

Here's a simple example of using PySyft for federated learning:

```python
import torch
import syft as sy

# create a couple of workers
bob = sy.VirtualWorker(hook, id="bob")
alice = sy.VirtualWorker(hook, id="alice")

# A Toy Dataset
data = torch.tensor([[1.,1],[0,1],[1,0],[0,0]], requires_grad=True)
target = torch.tensor([[1.],[1],[0],[0]], requires_grad=True)

# send data to workers
data_bob = data[0:2].send(bob)
target_bob = target[0:2].send(bob)
data_alice = data[2:].send(alice)
target_alice = target[2:].send(alice)

datasets = [(data_bob, target_bob), (data_alice, target_alice)]

def train():
    # Training Logic
    model = nn.Linear(2,1)
    opt = optim.SGD(params=model.parameters(),lr=0.1)
    
    for iter in range(10):
        
        for _data, _target in datasets:

            # send model to the data
            model = model.send(_data.location)

            # do normal training
            opt.zero_grad()
            pred = model(_data)
            loss = ((pred - _target)**2).sum()
            loss.backward()
            opt.step()

            # get smarter model back
            model = model.get()

            print(loss.get())

train()
```

In this tutorial, we have explored differential privacy and federated learning, two important techniques for privacy-preserving machine learning. We have also seen how PyTorch and its libraries support these techniques. As privacy becomes increasingly important in machine learning, these techniques will become more and more essential.
