# Factoring Polynomials

Factoring is a key concept in mathematics, especially when dealing with polynomials. It involves breaking down a polynomial into simpler parts that, when multiplied together, give the original polynomial. This tutorial will guide you through different methods to factor polynomials.

## Task 1: Factor out the Greatest Common Factor from a Polynomial

The first step in factoring a polynomial is to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of all the terms. The GCF is the largest number or term that divides evenly into each term of the polynomial.

Let's take an example:

Consider the polynomial `6x^3 + 9x^2 - 15x`.

The GCF of the coefficients (6, 9, -15) is 3, and the GCF of the variables (x^3, x^2, x) is x. So, the GCF of the polynomial is `3x`.

Now, divide each term of the polynomial by the GCF:

`6x^3 รท 3x = 2x^2`

`9x^2 รท 3x = 3x`

`-15x รท 3x = -5`

So, the factored form of the polynomial is `3x(2x^2 + 3x - 5)`.

## Task 2: Factor Trinomials

A trinomial is a polynomial with three terms. To factor a trinomial, we look for two numbers that add up to the coefficient of the middle term and multiply to the product of the coefficient of the first and last term.

Consider the trinomial `x^2 + 5x + 6`.

We need to find two numbers that add up to 5 and multiply to 6. The numbers 2 and 3 meet these conditions.

So, the factored form of the trinomial is `(x + 2)(x + 3)`.

## Task 3: Solve Quadratic Equations by Factoring

Factoring is a useful method to solve quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is an equation of the form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`.

Let's solve the equation `x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0`.

First, we factor the left side of the equation:

`x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)`

Then, we set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:

`x + 2 = 0` gives `x = -2`

`x + 3 = 0` gives `x = -3`

So, the solutions of the equation are `x = -2` and `x = -3`.

Remember, factoring is a powerful tool in mathematics. It simplifies complex polynomials and makes solving equations easier. Practice factoring different types of polynomials to get a good grasp of this concept.
