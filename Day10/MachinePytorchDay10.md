# Transfer Learning with PyTorch

Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. It is a popular approach in deep learning where pre-trained models are used as the starting point on computer vision and natural language processing tasks.

In this tutorial, we will apply transfer learning to improve model performance using PyTorch. We will use a pre-trained model, modify its final layer to fit our dataset, and fine-tune the model on our dataset.

## Task 1: Load a Pre-Trained Model

We will use the ResNet model from torchvision, which is a popular model for image classification tasks. ResNet, or Residual Networks, is a model that introduced the concept of skip connections, which allows the model to have very deep layers without the problem of vanishing gradients.

```python
import torch
from torchvision import models

# Load the pre-trained model
resnet = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)

# Print the model structure
print(resnet)
```

## Task 2: Modify the Final Layer to Fit Your Dataset

The pre-trained model was trained on ImageNet, which has 1000 classes. If your dataset has a different number of classes, you need to modify the final layer of the model.

```python
# Number of classes in your dataset
num_classes = 10

# Replace the final layer
resnet.fc = torch.nn.Linear(resnet.fc.in_features, num_classes)
```

## Task 3: Fine-Tune the Model on Your Dataset and Evaluate

Now, we can fine-tune the model on our dataset. We will use the Cross-Entropy Loss as our loss function and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as our optimizer.

```python
# Loss function and optimizer
criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(resnet.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for inputs, labels in dataloader:
        # Forward pass
        outputs = resnet(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        
        # Backward pass and optimization
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

After training, we can evaluate the model on our test set.

```python
# Evaluation
resnet.eval()
correct = 0
total = 0
with torch.no_grad():
    for images, labels in test_loader:
        outputs = resnet(images)
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
        total += labels.size(0)
        correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()

print('Accuracy of the model on the test images: {} %'.format(100 * correct / total))
```

In this tutorial, we have learned how to apply transfer learning to improve model performance using PyTorch. We loaded a pre-trained model, modified its final layer to fit our dataset, and fine-tuned the model on our dataset.
