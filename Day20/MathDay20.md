# Day 20: Algebraic Equations and Their Graphs

## Brief Introduction
Today, we will dive into the world of algebraic equations and their graphs. We will learn how to draw these graphs and understand the relationship between the equation and its graph.

## Learning Objective
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to graph different types of algebraic equations.

## Task 1: Graph Linear Equations

A linear equation is an equation that forms a straight line when graphed. It has the general form `y = mx + b`, where `m` is the slope of the line and `b` is the y-intercept.

To graph a linear equation:

1. Identify the slope `m` and the y-intercept `b` from the equation.
2. Plot the y-intercept on the y-axis.
3. From the y-intercept, use the slope to find another point on the line. The slope is the rise (change in y) over the run (change in x).
4. Draw a line through the two points.

For example, let's graph the equation `y = 2x + 1`.

1. The slope `m` is 2 and the y-intercept `b` is 1.
2. Plot the point (0,1) on the y-axis.
3. From (0,1), move up 2 units and right 1 unit to get to the point (1,3).
4. Draw a line through (0,1) and (1,3).

## Task 2: Understand the Characteristics of Quadratic Equation Graphs

A quadratic equation is an equation of the form `y = ax^2 + bx + c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants. The graph of a quadratic equation is a curve called a parabola.

Characteristics of the graph of a quadratic equation:

1. The graph is symmetric about a vertical line called the axis of symmetry.
2. The highest or lowest point of the graph is called the vertex.
3. If `a` is positive, the graph opens upwards and the vertex is the minimum point. If `a` is negative, the graph opens downwards and the vertex is the maximum point.

## Task 3: Explore and Graph Exponential Functions

An exponential function is a function of the form `y = a * b^x`, where `a` and `b` are constants, and `b` is positive and not equal to 1.

To graph an exponential function:

1. Identify the base `b` and the constant `a` from the equation.
2. If `b` is greater than 1, the function is increasing. If `b` is less than 1, the function is decreasing.
3. The y-intercept is the point (0, `a`).
4. Plot a few more points by substituting different x-values into the equation.
5. Draw a smooth curve through the points.

For example, let's graph the function `y = 2 * 3^x`.

1. The base `b` is 3 and the constant `a` is 2.
2. Since `b` is greater than 1, the function is increasing.
3. The y-intercept is (0,2).
4. Plot a few more points, such as (1,6) and (2,18).
5. Draw a smooth curve through the points.

Remember, practice makes perfect. Keep practicing graphing these equations until you feel comfortable with the process. Happy graphing!
