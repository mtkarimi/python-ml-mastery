# Utilizing GPUs for Faster Model Training in PyTorch

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are powerful tools for accelerating the training of machine learning models. In this tutorial, we will learn how to use GPUs to speed up model training in PyTorch.

## Task 1: Understand how to move tensors and models to a GPU

To use a GPU in PyTorch, we first need to move our data and model to the GPU. PyTorch makes this easy with the `.to()` method.

```python
# Check if a GPU is available and if not, use a CPU
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')

# Move tensor to the GPU
tensor = tensor.to(device)

# Move model to the GPU
model = model.to(device)
```

The `torch.device` function is used to set the device (GPU or CPU) that we want to use. The `torch.cuda.is_available()` function checks if a GPU is available. If a GPU is available, 'cuda' is set as the device, otherwise 'cpu' is set.

The `.to(device)` method is then used to move our data (tensors) and model to the chosen device.

## Task 2: Modify a training loop to utilize GPU acceleration

Next, we need to modify our training loop to use the GPU. This involves moving both the input data and the target data to the GPU for each batch.

```python
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for i, (inputs, targets) in enumerate(train_loader):
        # Move data to GPU
        inputs = inputs.to(device)
        targets = targets.to(device)
        
        # Forward pass
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
        
        # Backward pass and optimize
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

In this code, `inputs` and `targets` are moved to the GPU at the start of each batch. The rest of the training loop remains the same.

## Task 3: Compare training times and performance between CPU and GPU

Finally, we can compare the training times and performance of our model when trained on a CPU versus a GPU.

```python
import time

# Train on CPU
start_time = time.time()
train_model(model, device='cpu')
cpu_time = time.time() - start_time

# Train on GPU
start_time = time.time()
train_model(model, device='cuda')
gpu_time = time.time() - start_time

print(f'Training time on CPU: {cpu_time:.2f}s')
print(f'Training time on GPU: {gpu_time:.2f}s')
```

In this code, we use the `time.time()` function to record the start time of the training, and then subtract it from the current time after training to get the total training time. We do this for both CPU and GPU training, and then print out the results.

In general, you should find that training on a GPU is significantly faster than training on a CPU. However, the exact speedup will depend on the specifics of your model and data.

Remember, while GPUs can greatly speed up model training, they are not always necessary or beneficial. For small models or datasets, the overhead of moving data to and from the GPU may outweigh the benefits of GPU acceleration. Always consider the trade-offs when deciding whether to use a GPU.
