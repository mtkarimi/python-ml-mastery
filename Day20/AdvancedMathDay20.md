# Day 20: Logic and Proof Techniques in Discrete Mathematics

## Introduction
Logic and proof techniques are the backbone of mathematical reasoning. They help us understand and explain why certain mathematical statements are true. In this tutorial, we will explore the basics of logic and proof techniques.

## Task 1: Propositions, Logical Connectives, and Truth Tables

### Propositions
A proposition is a statement that is either true or false, but not both. For example, "The sky is blue" is a proposition.

### Logical Connectives
Logical connectives are symbols that connect propositions to form more complex propositions. The main logical connectives are:

- AND ( ∧ ): The proposition "P ∧ Q" is true if both P and Q are true.
- OR ( ∨ ): The proposition "P ∨ Q" is true if either P or Q, or both, are true.
- NOT ( ¬ ): The proposition "¬P" is true if P is false.

### Truth Tables
A truth table is a table that shows the truth value of a proposition for all possible truth values of its simple propositions. For example, the truth table for "P ∧ Q" is:

| P | Q | P ∧ Q |
|---|---|-------|
| T | T | T     |
| T | F | F     |
| F | T | F     |
| F | F | F     |

## Task 2: Direct Proof, Proof by Contradiction, and Proof by Induction

### Direct Proof
A direct proof is a way of proving a statement by showing that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. It follows a straightforward path from assumptions to conclusion.

### Proof by Contradiction
Proof by contradiction, also known as reductio ad absurdum, is a way of proving a statement by assuming that the statement is false and then showing that this assumption leads to a contradiction.

### Proof by Induction
Proof by induction is a way of proving a statement for all natural numbers. It consists of two steps: the base case (proving the statement for the first natural number) and the inductive step (proving that if the statement holds for some natural number, then it also holds for the next natural number).

## Task 3: Practice Applying These Techniques to Prove Mathematical Theorems and Statements

Now that you know the basics of logic and proof techniques, it's time to practice applying them to prove mathematical theorems and statements. Remember, practice is key to mastering these techniques. Happy learning!
