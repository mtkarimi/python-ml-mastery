# The Central Limit Theorem in Probability & Statistics

## Introduction
The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a key idea in statistics. It tells us that if we have a lot of numbers, and we add them up, the total will be close to a normal distribution (a bell curve) - no matter what the shape of the original distribution is. This is very useful in many areas of science and engineering.

## Learning Objective
By the end of this lesson, you should understand what the Central Limit Theorem is and how it is used in hypothesis testing. You should also be able to solve problems that involve the Central Limit Theorem.

## Task 1: Understand the Statement and Implications of the Central Limit Theorem

The Central Limit Theorem states that if you have a large number of independent, identically distributed variables, the distribution of their sum (or average) will approach a normal distribution, no matter the shape of the original distribution.

This is important because it means that we can make predictions about the sum or average of a large set of data, even if we don't know anything about the original distribution.

For example, let's say we have a large bag of marbles, and we know that the average weight of a marble is 5 grams, but we don't know anything else about the distribution of weights. If we take a sample of 100 marbles and weigh them, the Central Limit Theorem tells us that the total weight will be close to 500 grams (100 marbles times 5 grams per marble), and the distribution of total weights from many samples will be close to a normal distribution.

## Task 2: Learn How to Apply the Central Limit Theorem in Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is a method used in statistics to decide whether a result from a data sample is a good reason to reject a null hypothesis. The Central Limit Theorem is used in hypothesis testing to calculate the probability of a particular outcome.

For example, let's say we have a sample of 100 marbles from our bag, and the total weight is 520 grams. We want to know if this is a good reason to reject the null hypothesis that the average weight of a marble is 5 grams.

Using the Central Limit Theorem, we can calculate the standard deviation of the distribution of total weights, and then calculate the z-score of our sample (the number of standard deviations away from the mean). If the z-score is large (for example, greater than 2), we can reject the null hypothesis with a high level of confidence.

## Task 3: Practice Solving Problems That Involve the Central Limit Theorem

Now that you understand the Central Limit Theorem and how it is used in hypothesis testing, it's time to practice solving problems. Here are a few problems to get you started:

1. A factory produces light bulbs, and the lifetime of a bulb is normally distributed with a mean of 1000 hours and a standard deviation of 100 hours. If a sample of 100 bulbs is selected, what is the probability that the average lifetime of the sample is less than 950 hours?

2. A school has 1000 students, and the distribution of heights is normally distributed with a mean of 160 cm and a standard deviation of 10 cm. If a sample of 50 students is selected, what is the probability that the average height of the sample is greater than 165 cm?

3. A company produces batteries, and the lifetime of a battery is normally distributed with a mean of 500 hours and a standard deviation of 50 hours. If a sample of 200 batteries is selected, what is the probability that the average lifetime of the sample is between 490 and 510 hours?

Remember, the key to solving these problems is to use the Central Limit Theorem to calculate the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means, and then use this to calculate the z-score and the probability of the particular outcome.
