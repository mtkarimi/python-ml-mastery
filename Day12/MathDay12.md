# Day 12: Percentages

## Introduction
Percentages are a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. It is often used to compare quantities. The symbol for percent is `%`. For example, 50% is the same as 50 out of 100, or 1/2.

## Learning Objective
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to convert between fractions, decimals, and percentages, calculate the percentage of a number, and solve real-world problems involving discounts, tax, and tips.

## Task 1: Convert between fractions, decimals, and percentages

### Fractions to Percentages
To convert a fraction to a percentage, divide the top number (numerator) by the bottom number (denominator), multiply by 100, and add the `%` symbol. 

For example, to convert 3/4 to a percentage:
1. Divide 3 by 4 to get 0.75.
2. Multiply 0.75 by 100 to get 75.
3. So, 3/4 is equal to 75%.

### Decimals to Percentages
To convert a decimal to a percentage, multiply by 100 and add the `%` symbol.

For example, to convert 0.8 to a percentage:
1. Multiply 0.8 by 100 to get 80.
2. So, 0.8 is equal to 80%.

### Percentages to Fractions or Decimals
To convert a percentage to a fraction or a decimal, divide it by 100.

For example, to convert 20% to a fraction and a decimal:
1. Divide 20 by 100 to get 0.2 (a decimal).
2. 0.2 is the same as 2/10 or 1/5 (a fraction).

## Task 2: Calculate the percentage of a number
To find the percentage of a number, divide the percentage by 100 to convert it to a decimal, then multiply by the number.

For example, to find 30% of 200:
1. Divide 30 by 100 to get 0.3.
2. Multiply 0.3 by 200 to get 60.
3. So, 30% of 200 is 60.

## Task 3: Solve real-world problems involving discounts, tax, and tips
Percentages are often used in real-world situations like calculating discounts, tax, and tips.

### Discounts
If an item is on sale for 20% off, you can calculate the discount by finding 20% of the original price, then subtracting that amount from the original price.

For example, if a $50 item is 20% off:
1. Find 20% of $50 (which is $10).
2. Subtract $10 from $50 to get the sale price of $40.

### Tax
If you need to calculate the tax on a $100 item with a 5% sales tax:
1. Find 5% of $100 (which is $5).
2. Add $5 to $100 to get the total price of $105.

### Tips
If you want to leave a 15% tip on a $20 meal:
1. Find 15% of $20 (which is $3).
2. Add $3 to $20 to get the total amount of $23.

## Conclusion
Percentages are a useful tool for comparing quantities and solving real-world problems. By understanding how to convert between fractions, decimals, and percentages, and how to calculate the percentage of a number, you can apply this knowledge to a variety of situations.
