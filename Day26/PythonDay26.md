# Day 26: Web Scraping with Python - Advanced

In this tutorial, we will delve into advanced web scraping techniques using Python. We will learn how to scrape data that is loaded dynamically with JavaScript, handle pagination and multi-page navigation, and responsibly manage scraping frequency to respect webmaster guidelines.

## Task 1: Scrape data that is loaded dynamically with JavaScript

Many modern websites load data dynamically using JavaScript. Traditional scraping tools like BeautifulSoup can't handle this as they don't execute JavaScript. We can use Selenium, a powerful tool that allows us to interact with JavaScript-based websites.

First, install Selenium and a WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome).

```python
pip install selenium
```

Here's a simple example of using Selenium to scrape a JavaScript-based website:

```python
from selenium import webdriver

# Initialize the driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome('/path/to/chromedriver')

# Open the webpage
driver.get('http://www.example.com')

# Extract data
data = driver.find_element_by_id('element_id').text

# Close the driver
driver.quit()
```

## Task 2: Handle pagination and multi-page navigation

Many websites split their data across multiple pages. We can navigate these pages using Selenium's click function.

Here's an example of navigating a paginated website:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.common.exceptions import NoSuchElementException

driver = webdriver.Chrome('/path/to/chromedriver')
driver.get('http://www.example.com')

while True:
    # Extract data from the current page
    data = driver.find_element_by_id('element_id').text
    print(data)

    try:
        # Find and click the 'Next' button
        next_button = driver.find_element_by_id('next_button_id')
        next_button.click()
    except NoSuchElementException:
        # Exit the loop if 'Next' button is not found (i.e., we're on the last page)
        break

driver.quit()
```

## Task 3: Implement techniques to responsibly manage scraping frequency

Web scraping should be done responsibly to respect the website's resources and avoid getting your IP address banned. Here are some tips:

- **Obey robots.txt**: This file (e.g., www.example.com/robots.txt) tells web crawlers which parts of the site should not be crawled. You can use Python's `robotparser` module to check if a URL is allowed to be scraped.

- **Rate limiting**: Don't overload the website with too many requests in a short period. You can use Python's `time.sleep()` function to pause between requests.

- **User-Agent**: Some websites block requests with no User-Agent header. Always include a User-Agent in your requests.

Here's an example of responsible web scraping:

```python
import time
from urllib.robotparser import RobotFileParser

# Check robots.txt
rp = RobotFileParser()
rp.set_url('http://www.example.com/robots.txt')
rp.read()

url = 'http://www.example.com/page_to_scrape'
if rp.can_fetch('*', url):
    # Make the request
    driver.get(url)

    # Extract data
    data = driver.find_element_by_id('element_id').text

    # Wait before making the next request
    time.sleep(5)
else:
    print('This page cannot be crawled according to robots.txt')

driver.quit()
```

Remember, web scraping should always be done ethically and responsibly. Always respect the website's terms of service and privacy policies.
