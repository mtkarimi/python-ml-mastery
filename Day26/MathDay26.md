# Day 26: Differentiation

## Brief Introduction: The Derivative and Its Applications
Differentiation is a key concept in calculus that allows us to find the rate at which a quantity is changing. This is represented by the derivative of a function. The derivative can be thought of as the slope of a curve at a particular point, providing us with information about how the function behaves at that point.

## Learning Objective: Learn to Differentiate Functions
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to understand the concept of a derivative, differentiate common functions, and apply differentiation to solve real-world problems involving rates of change.

## Task 1: Understand the Derivative as the Slope of a Curve

Imagine you are walking up a hill. The steepness of the hill at any point is like the derivative of a function at that point. If the hill is steep, the derivative is high. If the hill is flat, the derivative is zero.

In math terms, the derivative of a function at a certain point is the slope of the tangent line to the function at that point. The tangent line is a straight line that just touches the curve at that point.

For example, consider the function `f(x) = x^2`. The derivative of this function is `f'(x) = 2x`, which tells us the slope of the curve at any point `x`.

## Task 2: Differentiate Common Functions

Differentiating a function involves applying rules. Here are some common rules:

1. **Power Rule**: If `f(x) = x^n`, then `f'(x) = n*x^(n-1)`.
2. **Product Rule**: If `f(x) = g(x)*h(x)`, then `f'(x) = g'(x)*h(x) + g(x)*h'(x)`.
3. **Quotient Rule**: If `f(x) = g(x)/h(x)`, then `f'(x) = (g'(x)*h(x) - g(x)*h'(x))/(h(x)^2)`.
4. **Chain Rule**: If `f(x) = g(h(x))`, then `f'(x) = g'(h(x))*h'(x)`.

Let's differentiate a function using these rules. Suppose `f(x) = x^3`. Using the power rule, `f'(x) = 3*x^2`.

## Task 3: Apply Differentiation to Solve Real-World Problems Involving Rates of Change

Differentiation is used in many fields to solve problems involving rates of change. For example, in physics, the velocity of an object is the derivative of its position with respect to time, and the acceleration is the derivative of velocity.

Suppose a car moves along a straight line and its position at time `t` is given by `s(t) = t^2`. The velocity of the car at time `t` is the derivative of `s(t)`, which is `v(t) = 2*t`. So, at time `t = 3`, the velocity of the car is `v(3) = 2*3 = 6` units per time.

In economics, differentiation is used to find marginal cost and marginal revenue, which are the costs and revenues of producing one more unit of a good.

In these ways, differentiation helps us understand and solve real-world problems involving rates of change.

In the next lesson, we will learn about integration, which is the reverse process of differentiation.
