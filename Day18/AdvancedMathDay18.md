# Sequences and Series in Calculus

## Introduction
Sequences and series are key parts of calculus. A sequence is an ordered list of numbers, while a series is the sum of a sequence. In this tutorial, we will explore these concepts in detail.

## Learning Objective
By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to understand the definitions and properties of sequences and series, learn about tests for convergence of series, and solve problems involving geometric and harmonic series.

## Task 1: Understand the Definitions and Properties of Sequences and Series

### Sequences
A sequence is an ordered list of numbers. Each number in the sequence is called a term. For example, the sequence {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} has five terms.

### Series
A series is the sum of a sequence. For example, the series of the sequence {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.

### Properties
Sequences and series have several properties. For example, a sequence can be finite (having a specific number of terms) or infinite (having an unlimited number of terms). A series can be convergent (the sum approaches a specific value) or divergent (the sum does not approach a specific value).

## Task 2: Learn About Tests for Convergence of Series

A series is said to converge if the sum of its terms approaches a specific value. There are several tests to determine whether a series converges or diverges.

### The Ratio Test
The ratio test states that if the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms in a series approaches a value less than 1, the series converges.

### The Root Test
The root test states that if the nth root of the absolute value of the nth term in a series approaches a value less than 1, the series converges.

### The Comparison Test
The comparison test states that if a series is less than or equal to a convergent series, it also converges.

## Task 3: Practice Solving Problems Involving Geometric and Harmonic Series

### Geometric Series
A geometric series is a series where each term is a constant multiple of the previous term. The sum of a geometric series can be found using the formula:

S = a / (1 - r)

where S is the sum, a is the first term, and r is the ratio between terms.

### Harmonic Series
A harmonic series is a series where each term is the reciprocal of a positive integer. The harmonic series diverges, meaning its sum does not approach a specific value.

## Conclusion
Understanding sequences and series is crucial in calculus. By learning their definitions, properties, and tests for convergence, you can solve complex problems involving these concepts. Practice with geometric and harmonic series will further solidify your understanding.
