# Day 18: Basic Calculus Concepts

## Brief Introduction
Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and the accumulation of quantities. It is divided into two main parts: differentiation and integration. Differentiation measures the rate of change of a function, while integration measures the total accumulation of quantities. 

## Learning Objective
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to understand the basic concepts of calculus, differentiate simple functions, and integrate simple functions.

## Task 1: Understand the Concept of a Limit

A limit is a fundamental concept in calculus. It describes the behavior of a function as its input (or 'x' value) gets closer and closer to a certain value. 

For example, let's consider the function f(x) = x^2. As x gets closer and closer to 2, f(x) gets closer and closer to 4. We can write this as: 

```
lim (x -> 2) of f(x) = 4
```

This means "the limit of f(x) as x approaches 2 is 4".

## Task 2: Differentiate Simple Functions

Differentiation is the process of finding the derivative of a function. The derivative measures how a function changes as its input changes. In other words, it measures the rate of change of a function.

For example, the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2 is f'(x) = 2x. This means that for each unit increase in x, the function f(x) increases by 2x units.

Here's how you can find the derivative of a function:

1. If the function is a constant (like f(x) = 5), its derivative is 0.
2. If the function is a power of x (like f(x) = x^n), its derivative is nx^(n-1).
3. If the function is a sum or difference of functions (like f(x) = g(x) ± h(x)), its derivative is the sum or difference of the derivatives of g(x) and h(x).

## Task 3: Integrate Simple Functions

Integration is the reverse process of differentiation. It measures the total accumulation of quantities. The integral of a function can be thought of as the area under the curve of the function.

For example, the integral of the function f(x) = x^2 from x = 0 to x = 2 is 8/3. This means that the total accumulation of the function f(x) from 0 to 2 is 8/3.

Here's how you can find the integral of a function:

1. If the function is a constant (like f(x) = 5), its integral is 5x.
2. If the function is a power of x (like f(x) = x^n), its integral is (1/(n+1))x^(n+1).
3. If the function is a sum or difference of functions (like f(x) = g(x) ± h(x)), its integral is the sum or difference of the integrals of g(x) and h(x).

Remember, calculus is a powerful tool in mathematics and computer science. It's used in many areas, including physics, engineering, economics, statistics, and machine learning. So, understanding the basic concepts of calculus is essential for anyone interested in these fields.
