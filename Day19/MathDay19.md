# Circle Geometry

## Introduction

A circle is a shape with all points the same distance from its center. In this lesson, we will learn about the properties and formulas of circles. We will understand how to calculate the circumference and area of a circle, and solve problems involving the properties of tangents and secants.

## Task 1: Define and calculate the circumference of a circle

The circumference of a circle is the distance around it. It is calculated using the formula:

```
Circumference = 2πr
```

where `r` is the radius of the circle and `π` (Pi) is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159.

For example, if a circle has a radius of 5 units, its circumference would be:

```
Circumference = 2π * 5 = 10π ≈ 31.42 units
```

## Task 2: Calculate the area of a circle

The area of a circle is the number of square units that can fit inside it. It is calculated using the formula:

```
Area = πr²
```

where `r` is the radius of the circle.

For example, if a circle has a radius of 3 units, its area would be:

```
Area = π * 3² = 9π ≈ 28.27 square units
```

## Task 3: Solve problems involving the properties of tangents and secants

A tangent is a line that touches a circle at exactly one point, and a secant is a line that cuts a circle at two points.

### Properties of Tangents

1. The tangent at any point of a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of contact.
2. Tangents drawn from the same point outside a circle are equal in length.

### Properties of Secants

1. If two secants are drawn from a point outside the circle, the product of the lengths of one secant and its external segment is equal to the product of the lengths of the other secant and its external segment.

Let's consider an example:

Suppose we have a circle with a tangent line `AB` touching the circle at point `C`, and a secant line `DE` intersecting the circle at points `F` and `G`. If `AC = 4 units`, `BC = 3 units`, `DF = 2 units`, and `FE = 3 units`, we can use the properties of tangents and secants to find `DG`.

According to the properties of secants:

```
DF * DE = DG * GE
```

Substituting the given values:

```
2 * (2 + 3) = DG * 3
```

Solving for `DG` gives us `DG = 10/3 units`.

This lesson should give you a basic understanding of circle geometry and how to solve problems involving the properties of circles.
