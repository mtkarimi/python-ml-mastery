# Multivariable Calculus: Partial Derivatives

## Introduction
In the realm of multivariable calculus, we often deal with functions of more than one variable. These functions are a bit more complex than the single-variable functions we've studied in basic calculus. One of the key concepts in multivariable calculus is the partial derivative. 

## Learning Objective
By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to understand the concept of partial derivatives, calculate them for various functions, and apply them in optimization and economic models.

## Task 1: Concept of Partial Derivatives and Their Geometric Interpretation

### What is a Partial Derivative?
A partial derivative of a function of several variables is its derivative with respect to one of those variables, with the others held constant. 

For example, consider a function `f(x, y)`. The partial derivative of `f` with respect to `x` (denoted as `∂f/∂x` or `f_x`) is the derivative of `f` considering `x` as the variable and `y` as a constant. Similarly, `∂f/∂y` or `f_y` is the derivative of `f` considering `y` as the variable and `x` as a constant.

### Geometric Interpretation
Geometrically, the partial derivative `∂f/∂x` at a point `(a, b)` gives the slope of the tangent line to the curve obtained by intersecting the surface `z = f(x, y)` with a vertical plane passing through `(a, b, f(a, b))` parallel to the `xz`-plane. Similarly, `∂f/∂y` gives the slope of the tangent line to the curve obtained by intersecting the surface with a vertical plane parallel to the `yz`-plane.

## Task 2: Calculating Partial Derivatives

Calculating partial derivatives involves treating all other variables as constants while differentiating with respect to the variable of interest. 

For example, let's calculate the partial derivatives of the function `f(x, y) = x^2y + 3y + 2x`.

- The partial derivative with respect to `x` is: `∂f/∂x = 2xy + 2`.
- The partial derivative with respect to `y` is: `∂f/∂y = x^2 + 3`.

## Task 3: Applications of Partial Derivatives

Partial derivatives have many applications, particularly in physics, engineering, and economics. They are used to find the rate of change of a quantity with respect to another, while keeping other quantities constant. 

For example, in economics, the partial derivative of the cost function with respect to the quantity of a product gives the marginal cost, i.e., the rate of change of the total cost with respect to the quantity, when all other factors are held constant.

In optimization, partial derivatives are used to find local maxima and minima of functions of several variables. A point is a local minimum (or maximum) if its value is less than (or greater than) the values at all nearby points.

## Conclusion
Partial derivatives are a fundamental concept in multivariable calculus. They allow us to understand how a function changes with respect to one variable while keeping others constant. This concept is widely used in various fields, from physics and engineering to economics and optimization. Practice calculating partial derivatives and applying them in different contexts to solidify your understanding.
