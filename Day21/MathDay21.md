# Sequences and Series

## Introduction
Sequences and series are important concepts in mathematics. A sequence is a list of numbers in a certain order, while a series is the sum of a sequence. There are two main types of sequences and series: arithmetic and geometric. 

## Learning Objective
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to identify and classify sequences as either arithmetic or geometric, calculate the nth term of these sequences, and sum the terms of these series.

## Task 1: Identify and Classify Sequences

### Arithmetic Sequences
An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where the difference between any two successive members is a constant. For example, the sequence 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 is an arithmetic sequence because the difference between each term is 2.

### Geometric Sequences
A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the ratio. For example, the sequence 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 is a geometric sequence because each term is twice the previous term.

## Task 2: Calculate the nth Term of Sequences

### Arithmetic Sequences
The nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula:

`a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) * d`

where:
- `a_n` is the nth term
- `a_1` is the first term
- `d` is the common difference

### Geometric Sequences
The nth term of a geometric sequence can be found using the formula:

`a_n = a_1 * r^(n - 1)`

where:
- `a_n` is the nth term
- `a_1` is the first term
- `r` is the common ratio

## Task 3: Sum the Terms of Series

### Arithmetic Series
The sum of the first n terms, `S_n`, of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula:

`S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n)`

where:
- `S_n` is the sum of the first n terms
- `a_1` is the first term
- `a_n` is the nth term

### Geometric Series
The sum of the first n terms, `S_n`, of a geometric series can be found using the formula:

`S_n = a_1 * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)`

where:
- `S_n` is the sum of the first n terms
- `a_1` is the first term
- `r` is the common ratio

Remember, practice is key to mastering these concepts. Try to solve different problems involving sequences and series to reinforce your understanding.
