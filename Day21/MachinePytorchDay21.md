# Day 21: Distributed Training in PyTorch

Distributed training is a method to scale up the training process across multiple machines or GPUs. It allows us to train larger models and datasets that would not fit on a single machine or GPU. In this tutorial, we will learn how to implement distributed training for a PyTorch model.

## Task 1: Understand the basics of distributed training in PyTorch

Distributed training involves splitting the training process across multiple machines or GPUs. Each machine or GPU processes a subset of the data and updates a shared model. This can significantly speed up the training process, especially for large models and datasets.

PyTorch provides several tools for distributed training, including:

- `torch.nn.DataParallel`: This is a wrapper that enables parallel GPU utilization.
- `torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`: This is a wrapper that enables parallel and distributed training.
- `torch.utils.data.distributed.DistributedSampler`: This is a sampler that restricts data loading to a subset of the dataset.

## Task 2: Setup a simple distributed training example on multiple GPUs

Let's set up a simple example of distributed training on multiple GPUs. We will use the `torch.nn.DataParallel` wrapper for this purpose.

First, we need to check if multiple GPUs are available:

```python
import torch

if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
  print("Let's use", torch.cuda.device_count(), "GPUs!")
```

Next, we can define a simple model and move it to the GPU:

```python
model = torch.nn.Linear(10, 1).cuda()
```

Then, we can wrap the model with `torch.nn.DataParallel`:

```python
model = torch.nn.DataParallel(model)
```

Now, we can train the model as usual. The model will automatically be trained on all available GPUs.

## Task 3: Observe and compare the training efficiency with distributed training

To observe the training efficiency with distributed training, we can compare the training time with and without distributed training.

Without distributed training, the training time might be quite long, especially for large models and datasets. With distributed training, the training time should be significantly reduced.

However, keep in mind that distributed training also has some overhead. For example, the model parameters need to be synchronized across all machines or GPUs after each update. Therefore, the speedup from distributed training might be less than the number of machines or GPUs.

In conclusion, distributed training is a powerful tool to scale up the training process in PyTorch. It allows us to train larger models and datasets that would not fit on a single machine or GPU. However, it also has some overhead and requires careful setup and management.
