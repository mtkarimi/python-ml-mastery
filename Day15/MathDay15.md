# Day 15: Introduction to Probability

## Brief Introduction: Basics of Probability

Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with the likelihood of events happening. It is a measure of how likely something is to happen. In this lesson, we will learn about the basics of probability and how to calculate simple probabilities.

## Learning Objective: Understand and Calculate Simple Probabilities

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to define probability and its basic terminology, calculate the probability of a single event, and use probability to solve simple real-world scenarios.

## Task 1: Define Probability and Its Basic Terminology

Probability is a measure of the likelihood that a particular event will occur. It is calculated by dividing the number of ways an event can occur by the total number of possible outcomes. The result is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means the event will not happen and 1 means the event is certain to happen.

Here are some basic terms related to probability:

- **Event**: An outcome or combination of outcomes of a random phenomenon. For example, getting a 6 when you roll a die is an event.
- **Outcome**: A possible result of a probability experiment. For example, when you roll a die, the outcomes could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
- **Sample Space**: The set of all possible outcomes. For example, the sample space when rolling a die is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

## Task 2: Calculate the Probability of a Single Event

The probability of an event is calculated using the following formula:

```
Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes
```

For example, let's calculate the probability of rolling a 6 on a fair six-sided die. The number of favorable outcomes is 1 (there's only one 6 on the die), and the total number of outcomes is 6 (a die has six faces). So, the probability is 1/6 or approximately 0.167.

## Task 3: Use Probability to Solve Simple Real-World Scenarios

Let's consider a real-world scenario. Suppose you have a bag with 3 red balls and 2 blue balls. What is the probability of drawing a red ball?

The number of favorable outcomes is 3 (the number of red balls), and the total number of outcomes is 5 (the total number of balls). So, the probability of drawing a red ball is 3/5 or 0.6.

Remember, probability is a way of quantifying the uncertainty associated with events chosen out of a universe of events. The higher the probability, the more likely the event is to happen.
