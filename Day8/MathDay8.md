# Systems of Linear Equations

## Introduction

A system of linear equations is a set of two or more linear equations that all contain the same set of variables. A solution to a system of equations is a set of values for the variables that satisfies all the equations in the system simultaneously.

## Task 1: Solve Systems of Equations by Graphing

To solve a system of equations by graphing, we graph each equation on the same set of axes. The point where the graphs intersect is the solution to the system.

For example, consider the system of equations:

1. y = 2x + 1
2. y = -x + 3

We graph these two equations on the same set of axes. The point where the two lines intersect is the solution to the system. In this case, the lines intersect at the point (1, 3), so the solution to the system is x = 1, y = 3.

## Task 2: Use the Substitution Method to Solve Systems of Equations

The substitution method involves solving one of the equations for one variable in terms of the other variables, and then substituting this expression into the other equation(s).

For example, consider the system of equations:

1. y = 2x + 1
2. x + y = 4

We can solve the first equation for y, and then substitute this expression into the second equation:

1. Substitute y = 2x + 1 into the second equation: x + (2x + 1) = 4
2. Simplify to get 3x + 1 = 4
3. Solve for x to get x = 1
4. Substitute x = 1 into the first equation to get y = 2*1 + 1 = 3

So the solution to the system is x = 1, y = 3.

## Task 3: Apply the Elimination Method to Solve Systems of Equations

The elimination method involves adding or subtracting the equations in order to eliminate one of the variables, making it possible to solve for the other variable.

For example, consider the system of equations:

1. x + y = 4
2. x - y = 2

We can subtract the second equation from the first to get:

(x + y) - (x - y) = 4 - 2

This simplifies to 2y = 2, so y = 1. Substituting y = 1 into the first equation gives x + 1 = 4, so x = 3. So the solution to the system is x = 3, y = 1.

In conclusion, systems of linear equations can be solved by graphing, substitution, or elimination. Each method has its own advantages and is best suited to certain types of problems.
