# Day 8: Differentiation and Its Applications

## Brief Introduction
Differentiation is a key concept in calculus. It helps us understand how things change. For example, it can tell us how fast a car is moving at any given moment, or how much a company's profit changes when it sells one more product. 

## Learning Objective
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to differentiate functions and apply differentiation to solve problems.

## Task 1: Learn the Rules of Differentiation

### The Power Rule
The power rule is a basic theorem in calculus used to find the derivative of a function that is a power of x. Here's the rule:

If `f(x) = x^n`, then the derivative of `f` with respect to `x` is `f'(x) = n*x^(n-1)`.

### The Product Rule
The product rule is used when differentiating products of two or more functions. Here's the rule:

If `f(x) = g(x) * h(x)`, then `f'(x) = g'(x) * h(x) + g(x) * h'(x)`.

### The Quotient Rule
The quotient rule is used when differentiating quotients of functions. Here's the rule:

If `f(x) = g(x) / h(x)`, then `f'(x) = (g'(x) * h(x) - g(x) * h'(x)) / (h(x))^2`.

### The Chain Rule
The chain rule is used when differentiating compositions of functions. Here's the rule:

If `f(x) = g(h(x))`, then `f'(x) = g'(h(x)) * h'(x)`.

## Task 2: Understand the Concept of Derivative as a Rate of Change

The derivative of a function at a certain point can be interpreted as the rate of change of the function at that point. For example, if `f(x)` represents the position of a car at time `x`, then `f'(x)` represents the speed of the car at time `x`.

## Task 3: Apply Differentiation to Solve Problems in Physics and Economics

Differentiation has many applications in physics and economics. Here are a couple of examples:

### Physics: Motion
In physics, the position of an object is often represented by a function `f(x)`. The derivative of this function, `f'(x)`, represents the velocity of the object. The second derivative, `f''(x)`, represents the acceleration of the object.

### Economics: Profit Maximization
In economics, a company's profit can be represented by a function `P(x)`, where `x` is the number of products sold. The derivative of this function, `P'(x)`, represents the marginal profit, which is the additional profit from selling one more product. To maximize profit, the company should continue producing as long as the marginal profit is positive.

## Conclusion
Differentiation is a powerful tool in calculus that allows us to understand rates of change and solve a wide range of problems in various fields. Practice differentiating various types of functions and applying differentiation in different contexts to become more comfortable with this concept.
