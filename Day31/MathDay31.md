# Transformations of Functions

In this lesson, we will learn about transformations of functions. Transformations can change the position, shape, and size of function graphs. We will focus on three types of transformations: translations (shifts), reflections, and stretching/compressing.

## Task 1: Translations (Shifts) of Functions

A translation moves a function up, down, left, or right on the graph. This is also known as shifting the function. 

### Vertical Translations

If we add a constant to a function, the graph of the function shifts up. If we subtract a constant, the graph shifts down. For example, if we have a function `f(x) = x^2`, and we add 3 to it, `f(x) = x^2 + 3`, the graph of the function shifts up by 3 units.

### Horizontal Translations

If we add a constant to `x` inside the function, the graph shifts to the left. If we subtract a constant from `x`, the graph shifts to the right. For example, if we have a function `f(x) = x^2`, and we replace `x` with `(x-2)`, `f(x) = (x-2)^2`, the graph of the function shifts to the right by 2 units.

## Task 2: Reflections of Functions

A reflection flips a function over a line, usually the x-axis or y-axis.

### Reflection Over the X-Axis

If we multiply a function by `-1`, the graph of the function reflects over the x-axis. For example, if we have a function `f(x) = x^2`, and we multiply it by `-1`, `f(x) = -x^2`, the graph of the function reflects over the x-axis.

### Reflection Over the Y-Axis

If we replace `x` with `-x` inside the function, the graph reflects over the y-axis. For example, if we have a function `f(x) = x^2`, and we replace `x` with `-x`, `f(x) = (-x)^2`, the graph of the function reflects over the y-axis.

## Task 3: Stretching and Compressing of Function Graphs

Stretching and compressing change the size of a function graph.

### Vertical Stretching and Compressing

If we multiply a function by a constant greater than 1, the graph stretches vertically. If we multiply by a constant between 0 and 1, the graph compresses vertically. For example, if we have a function `f(x) = x^2`, and we multiply it by 2, `f(x) = 2x^2`, the graph of the function stretches vertically.

### Horizontal Stretching and Compressing

If we replace `x` with `x/c` inside the function, where `c` is greater than 1, the graph stretches horizontally. If `c` is between 0 and 1, the graph compresses horizontally. For example, if we have a function `f(x) = x^2`, and we replace `x` with `x/2`, `f(x) = (x/2)^2`, the graph of the function compresses horizontally.

In the next lesson, we will learn about combining these transformations to create more complex function graphs.
