# Functions and Their Properties

In this lesson, we will delve into the concept of functions and their properties. We will understand the domain and range of a function, identify whether a function is even, odd, or neither, and explore the concept of inverse functions.

## Task 1: Understand the Domain and Range of a Function

A function is a special type of relation where each input has exactly one output. The set of all possible inputs for a function is called the **domain**, and the set of all possible outputs is called the **range**.

For example, consider the function `f(x) = x^2`. The domain of this function is all real numbers, because you can square any real number. The range, however, is only the set of all non-negative real numbers, because the square of a real number is always non-negative.

## Task 2: Identify Whether a Function is Even, Odd, or Neither

A function `f(x)` is called **even** if the value of the function at `x` is the same as the value of the function at `-x` for all `x` in the domain of `f`. In other words, `f(x) = f(-x)`. The graph of an even function is symmetric about the y-axis.

A function `f(x)` is called **odd** if the value of the function at `x` is the negative of the value of the function at `-x` for all `x` in the domain of `f`. In other words, `f(x) = -f(-x)`. The graph of an odd function is symmetric about the origin.

If a function is neither even nor odd, we simply say that the function is neither even nor odd.

For example, the function `f(x) = x^2` is even, because `f(x) = f(-x)` for all `x`. The function `f(x) = x^3` is odd, because `f(x) = -f(-x)` for all `x`. The function `f(x) = x^2 + x` is neither even nor odd.

## Task 3: Explore the Concept of Inverse Functions

The **inverse** of a function `f` is a function that "undoes" the action of `f`. If `f` takes `x` to `y`, then the inverse of `f` takes `y` back to `x`. We denote the inverse of `f` as `f^-1`.

For example, the inverse of the function `f(x) = x^2` (for non-negative `x`) is `f^-1(y) = sqrt(y)`, because if `f` takes `x` to `x^2`, then `f^-1` takes `x^2` back to `x`.

Note that not all functions have inverses. In order for a function to have an inverse, it must be a **one-to-one** function, which means that each output is produced by exactly one input.

In the next lesson, we will continue to explore more properties of functions.
