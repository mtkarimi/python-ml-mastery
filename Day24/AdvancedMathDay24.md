# Day 24: Markov Chains and Processes

## Introduction
Markov chains are mathematical models that describe a sequence of possible events, where the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. They are named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov.

## Task 1: Definition and Properties of Markov Chains

A **Markov chain** is a sequence of random variables X1, X2, X3, ..., with the Markov property, which states that the probability of moving to the next state depends only on the present state and not on the previous states.

### Properties of Markov Chains

1. **Memoryless Property**: The future states of the process are dependent solely on the present state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it.

2. **Time Homogeneity**: The properties of the process do not change over time.

3. **Discrete State Space**: The possible outcomes or states of the process are countable.

## Task 2: State Transition Matrices and Steady-State Vectors

The **state transition matrix**, denoted by P, is a square matrix that describes the transitions from one state to another in a Markov chain. Each entry Pij represents the probability of moving from state i to state j.

A **steady-state vector** is a probability vector that remains unchanged in the Markov chain process. If π is the steady-state vector of the Markov chain, then πP = π.

## Task 3: Applications of Markov Chains

Markov chains have wide applications in various fields:

1. **Queueing Theory**: Markov chains are used to model systems with limited resources where there may be queues, such as customers arriving at a bank or packets of data being transmitted over the internet.

2. **Genetics**: Markov chains can model the genetic variation in a population from one generation to the next.

3. **Economics**: Markov chains can model the changes in economies over time, such as the probabilities of a company's success or failure.

## Conclusion

Markov chains are powerful tools in mathematics and computer science. They provide a way to model complex systems and predict future states based on current conditions. Understanding Markov chains can help you solve problems in various fields, from computer science to economics to genetics.
