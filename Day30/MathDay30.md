# Conic Sections

## Introduction

Conic sections are the curves obtained when a cone is cut by a plane. They are important in many areas of mathematics and science. In this tutorial, we will explore the four types of conic sections: circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas.

## Task 1: Define and Classify Conic Sections

### Circle

A circle is a set of points in a plane that are all the same distance from a fixed point, called the center. The distance from the center to any point on the circle is called the radius.

### Ellipse

An ellipse is a set of points in a plane such that the sum of the distances from two fixed points, called the foci, to any point on the ellipse is constant.

### Parabola

A parabola is a set of points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point, called the focus, and a fixed line, called the directrix.

### Hyperbola

A hyperbola is a set of points in a plane such that the difference of the distances from two fixed points, called the foci, to any point on the hyperbola is constant.

## Task 2: Derive and Understand the Standard Equations of Conic Sections

### Circle

The standard equation of a circle with center at (h, k) and radius r is:

`(x - h)² + (y - k)² = r²`

### Ellipse

The standard equation of an ellipse with center at (h, k), horizontal radius a, and vertical radius b is:

`(x - h)²/a² + (y - k)²/b² = 1`

### Parabola

The standard equation of a parabola with vertex at (h, k) and focus at (h, k + p) is:

`(x - h)² = 4p(y - k)`

### Hyperbola

The standard equation of a hyperbola with center at (h, k), horizontal radius a, and vertical radius b is:

`(x - h)²/a² - (y - k)²/b² = 1`

## Task 3: Solve Problems Involving the Properties of Conic Sections

To solve problems involving conic sections, you need to understand their properties and how to use their equations. Here are some examples:

- To find the center, foci, and lengths of the axes of an ellipse, you can use the coefficients in its equation.
- To find the vertex, focus, and directrix of a parabola, you can use the coefficients in its equation.
- To find the center, foci, and lengths of the axes of a hyperbola, you can use the coefficients in its equation.

Remember, practice is key to mastering these concepts. Try solving different problems and use different methods to find the best approach for you.
