# Fourier Series and Transforms

## Introduction
Fourier series and transforms are powerful mathematical tools that break down functions into their frequency components. This is like taking a complex sound and identifying the individual notes that make it up. These techniques are used in many areas of computer science, including signal processing, image analysis, and data compression.

## Task 1: Fourier Series for Periodic Functions

### Concept of Fourier Series
A Fourier series is a way to represent a periodic function as an infinite sum of sine and cosine functions. These sine and cosine functions are called the "harmonics" of the original function. The idea is that any periodic function can be built up from these simple building blocks.

### Calculation of Fourier Series
To calculate the Fourier series of a function, we need to find the coefficients of the sine and cosine functions. This is done by integrating the function multiplied by the sine or cosine function over one period. The result is a set of coefficients that tell us how much of each harmonic is present in the original function.

## Task 2: Fourier Transform and Its Applications

### Concept of Fourier Transform
While the Fourier series is used for periodic functions, the Fourier transform is used for non-periodic functions. It transforms a function from the time domain (where the function is described in terms of time) to the frequency domain (where the function is described in terms of frequencies). 

### Applications of Fourier Transform
Fourier transforms are used in many areas of computer science. In signal processing, they are used to analyze the frequency components of a signal. In image analysis, they are used to analyze the spatial frequencies in an image, which can be used for image compression and enhancement. In data compression, they are used to transform data into a form that can be compressed more efficiently.

## Task 3: Solving Problems Using Fourier Series and Transforms

Fourier series and transforms are powerful tools for solving problems in computer science. Here are some examples:

- In signal processing, we can use the Fourier transform to analyze the frequency components of a signal. This can be used to filter out noise, to compress the signal, or to identify patterns in the signal.

- In image analysis, we can use the Fourier transform to analyze the spatial frequencies in an image. This can be used to enhance certain features of the image, to compress the image, or to identify patterns in the image.

- In data compression, we can use the Fourier transform to transform data into a form that can be compressed more efficiently. This is used in many types of data compression, including audio and video compression.

In all of these cases, the key is to transform the problem into the frequency domain, where it can be solved more easily.
