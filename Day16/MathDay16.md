# Day 16: Data Representation

## Brief Introduction

Data is a collection of facts, such as numbers, words, measurements, observations or descriptions of things. In computer science, data is anything in a form suitable for use with a computer. Data is often distinguished from programs. A program is a set of instructions that detail a task for the computer to perform.

In this lesson, we will learn how to visually represent data using charts and graphs. This is an important skill in computer science as it allows us to understand and interpret data more easily.

## Learning Objective

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to create and interpret different types of graphs and charts to visually represent data.

## Task 1: Create a Bar Graph

A bar graph is a chart that uses rectangular bars to represent data. The length of each bar is proportional to the quantity of the data it represents.

Here is how you can create a simple bar graph:

1. Identify the data that you want to represent. This could be anything from the number of apples you eat each day to the number of hours you spend on different activities.

2. On a piece of paper or on your computer, draw a horizontal and a vertical line that intersect at a right angle. This will be your graph.

3. Label the horizontal line (x-axis) with the categories of data you are representing. For example, if you are representing the number of hours you spend on different activities, your categories could be "Sleeping", "Eating", "Studying", etc.

4. Label the vertical line (y-axis) with the quantities of data. This could be the number of hours, the number of apples, etc.

5. For each category, draw a bar that extends from the x-axis to the corresponding quantity on the y-axis.

6. Make sure all bars are the same width.

## Task 2: Interpret a Histogram

A histogram is similar to a bar graph, but it is used to represent the distribution of numerical data. The x-axis represents the bins or intervals, and the y-axis represents the frequency.

To interpret a histogram:

1. Look at the x-axis to understand the range of data.

2. Look at the y-axis to understand the frequency of data.

3. The height of each bar represents the number of data points that fall within each bin.

4. The shape of the histogram can tell you a lot about the data. For example, if the histogram is skewed to the right, it means that there are a lot of data points on the lower end of the range.

## Task 3: Understand and Use Pie Charts to Display Data

A pie chart is a circular chart divided into sectors, where each sector represents a proportion of the whole.

To create a pie chart:

1. Identify the data that you want to represent.

2. Calculate the total of all data.

3. For each category, calculate its proportion of the total.

4. Draw a circle and divide it into sectors according to these proportions.

To interpret a pie chart, simply look at the size of each sector. The larger the sector, the larger its proportion of the total.

Remember, the key to understanding data is to ask questions. What does this graph tell me? What patterns can I see? What conclusions can I draw? By asking these questions, you can gain a deeper understanding of the data.
