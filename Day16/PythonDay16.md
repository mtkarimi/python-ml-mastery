# Python Data Analysis with Pandas and NumPy

Python is a powerful language for data analysis, largely due to libraries like Pandas and NumPy. These libraries provide high-level data structures and functions designed to make working with structured data fast, easy, and expressive.

## Task 1: Use NumPy to create, reshape, and manipulate numpy arrays

NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is a library for numerical computations in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.

### Creating NumPy Arrays

You can create a NumPy array using the `numpy.array()` function. For example:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1-dimensional array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr)
```

### Reshaping NumPy Arrays

You can change the shape of an array without changing its data using the `reshape()` function. For example:

```python
# Reshape the array to 2 rows and 3 columns
reshaped_arr = arr.reshape(2, 3)
print(reshaped_arr)
```

### Manipulating NumPy Arrays

NumPy provides a variety of functions to manipulate arrays. For example, you can use the `numpy.concatenate()` function to join two or more arrays along an existing axis.

```python
# Concatenate two arrays
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
concatenated_arr = np.concatenate((arr1, arr2))
print(concatenated_arr)
```

## Task 2: Read a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame and explore its basic properties

Pandas is a library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. The primary data structures in pandas are implemented as two classes: DataFrame and Series.

### Reading a CSV file into a DataFrame

You can read a CSV file into a DataFrame using the `pandas.read_csv()` function. For example:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read a CSV file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('file.csv')
```

### Exploring DataFrame Properties

You can explore the basic properties of a DataFrame using functions like `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()`. For example:

```python
# Display the first 5 rows of the DataFrame
print(df.head())

# Display a concise summary of the DataFrame
print(df.info())

# Display descriptive statistics of the DataFrame
print(df.describe())
```

## Task 3: Perform data filtering, grouping, and summarization using Pandas

Pandas provides a variety of functions to perform data manipulation tasks like filtering, grouping, and summarization.

### Filtering Data

You can filter rows in a DataFrame based on a condition. For example:

```python
# Filter rows where 'column1' is greater than 50
filtered_df = df[df['column1'] > 50]
```

### Grouping Data

You can group data using the `groupby()` function. For example:

```python
# Group data by 'column1'
grouped_df = df.groupby('column1')
```

### Summarizing Data

You can summarize data using functions like `sum()`, `mean()`, and `count()`. For example:

```python
# Calculate the sum of 'column2' for each group
summarized_df = grouped_df['column2'].sum()
```

By mastering these tasks, you can perform powerful data analysis with Python's Pandas and NumPy libraries.
