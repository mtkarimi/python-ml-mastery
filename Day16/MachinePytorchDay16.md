# Reinforcement Learning Basics with PyTorch

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent takes actions in the environment, and the environment responds to these actions and presents new situations to the agent. The environment also gives rewards or penalties in response to the agent's actions. The agent's objective is to learn a policy, which is a strategy to select actions that maximize the total reward over time.

## Task 1: Understand the concept of agents, environments, and rewards

In reinforcement learning, the agent is the decision-maker or learner, and the environment is everything the agent interacts with. The agent makes observations about the current state of the environment, takes actions based on these observations, and receives rewards or penalties from the environment based on the quality of its actions.

The reward is a feedback signal that tells the agent how well it is doing. The agent's goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward, or the discounted sum of rewards, over time.

## Task 2: Use an RL library or toolkit to setup a simple environment

We will use OpenAI's Gym, a widely used toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It provides several pre-defined environments for training agents. We will also use PyTorch, a popular deep learning library, to implement our reinforcement learning algorithms.

First, we need to install the necessary libraries:

```python
pip install gym
pip install torch
```

Next, we can create a simple environment:

```python
import gym

# Create the CartPole environment
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')

# Reset the environment and get the initial state
state = env.reset()

# Render the environment
env.render()
```

## Task 3: Implement a policy gradient or Q-learning algorithm to train an agent

We will implement a simple policy gradient algorithm called REINFORCE. The agent will have a policy network that takes the state of the environment as input and outputs the probabilities of taking each action. The agent selects actions according to this policy.

First, we define our policy network:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class PolicyNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, n_inputs, n_outputs):
        super(PolicyNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(n_inputs, n_outputs)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc(x)
        return torch.softmax(x, dim=-1)
```

Next, we implement the REINFORCE algorithm:

```python
import torch.optim as optim

# Create the policy network
policy = PolicyNetwork(env.observation_space.shape[0], env.action_space.n)

# Create the optimizer
optimizer = optim.Adam(policy.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Store the log probabilities and rewards for each episode
log_probs = []
rewards = []

for episode in range(1000):
    state = env.reset()
    for t in range(1000):
        # Select an action
        state = torch.from_numpy(state).float().unsqueeze(0)
        probs = policy(state)
        action = torch.multinomial(probs, num_samples=1)
        log_prob = torch.log(probs.squeeze(0)[action])

        # Take the action and get the reward and new state
        state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action.item())

        # Store the log probability and reward
        log_probs.append(log_prob)
        rewards.append(reward)

        if done:
            break

    # Compute the discounted rewards
    discounted_rewards = []
    for t in range(len(rewards)):
        Gt = 0 
        pw = 0
        for r in rewards[t:]:
            Gt = Gt + 0.99**pw * r
            pw = pw + 1
        discounted_rewards.append(Gt)

    # Normalize the discounted rewards
    discounted_rewards = torch.tensor(discounted_rewards)
    discounted_rewards = (discounted_rewards - discounted_rewards.mean()) / (discounted_rewards.std() + 1e-9)

    # Compute the policy gradient loss
    policy_gradient = []
    for log_prob, Gt in zip(log_probs, discounted_rewards):
        policy_gradient.append(-log_prob * Gt)
    policy_gradient = torch.stack(policy_gradient).sum()

    # Update the weights of the policy network
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    policy_gradient.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    # Reset the log probabilities and rewards
    log_probs = []
    rewards = []
```

This is a basic introduction to reinforcement learning with PyTorch. There are many more advanced topics and techniques in reinforcement learning, such as Q-learning, actor-critic methods, and deep reinforcement learning.
