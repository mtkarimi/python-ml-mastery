# Game Theory and Strategic Interaction

Game theory is a branch of mathematics that studies decision-making in situations where multiple players interact. It is used in various fields, including economics, politics, and biology. This tutorial will introduce you to the basics of game theory.

## Task 1: Nash Equilibrium and Dominant Strategies

### Nash Equilibrium

A Nash equilibrium is a state of a game where no player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy, given the strategies of the other players. In other words, it's a situation where everyone is doing the best they can, considering what others are doing.

Let's consider a simple game with two players. Each player can choose either to cooperate or to defect. If both cooperate, they each get 2 points. If both defect, they each get 1 point. If one cooperates and the other defects, the defector gets 3 points and the cooperator gets 0. In this game, the Nash equilibrium is for both players to defect. Even though they would both be better off if they both cooperated, the risk of the other player defecting makes defection the best strategy.

### Dominant Strategies

A dominant strategy is a strategy that is the best choice for a player, no matter what the other players do. In the game described above, defection is a dominant strategy. No matter what the other player does, a player is always better off defecting.

## Task 2: Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Games

### Cooperative Games

In a cooperative game, players can form binding agreements. For example, in the game described above, the players could agree to both cooperate. This would be enforceable, and they would both get 2 points.

### Non-Cooperative Games

In a non-cooperative game, players cannot form binding agreements. They must each make their decisions independently, considering the possible actions of the other players. The game described above is a non-cooperative game if the players cannot make binding agreements.

## Task 3: Applications of Game Theory

### Economics

In economics, game theory is used to model strategic interactions between firms in a market. For example, it can be used to analyze competition, bargaining, and auctions.

### Politics

In politics, game theory can be used to model strategic interactions between countries or political parties. For example, it can be used to analyze voting systems, power struggles, and international relations.

### Biology

In biology, game theory is used to model interactions between organisms. For example, it can be used to analyze predator-prey relationships, mating strategies, and evolution.

In conclusion, game theory provides a mathematical framework for analyzing strategic interactions. It has wide-ranging applications in various fields.
