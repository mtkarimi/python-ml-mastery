# Day 29: Probability Distributions

## Brief Introduction
Probability distributions are a key concept in statistics and data science. They help us understand the likelihood of different outcomes in an experiment. Today, we will explore different types of probability distributions.

## Learning Objective
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to understand and describe different types of probability distributions.

## Task 1: Define Discrete and Continuous Random Variables

A **random variable** is a variable whose possible values are outcomes of a random phenomenon. There are two types of random variables: discrete and continuous.

### Discrete Random Variables
A **discrete random variable** is one which may take on only a countable number of distinct values such as 0,1,2,3,4,... etc. Examples include the number of heads when flipping three coins, or the number of students present in a class.

### Continuous Random Variables
A **continuous random variable** is one which takes an infinite number of possible values. For example, the time taken to run a mile or the weight of a person are continuous variables.

## Task 2: Understand the Properties of Binomial Distributions

A **binomial distribution** is a type of discrete probability distribution. It describes the outcome of binary scenarios, e.g. toss of a coin, it will either be head or tails.

It has three characteristics:
1. The number of observations or trials is fixed. In other words, you can only figure out the probability of something happening if you do it a certain number of times.
2. Each observation or trial is independent. That means that none of your trials have an effect on the probability of the next trial.
3. The probability of success (tails, heads, fail or pass) is exactly the same from one trial to another.

## Task 3: Explore the Characteristics of Normal Distributions

A **normal distribution**, also known as Gaussian distribution, is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable. The graph of the normal distribution is characterized by two parameters: the mean and the standard deviation. The mean determines the location of the center of the graph, and the standard deviation determines the height and width of the graph.

When a dataset follows a normal distribution, 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% falls within two standard deviations, and 99.7% falls within three standard deviations.

This is a fundamental distribution in statistics and is often used in the natural and social sciences for real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known.

## Conclusion
Understanding probability distributions is crucial in statistics and data science. They provide the foundation for statistical inference, where we use data to draw conclusions about a population.
