# Day 2: The Concept of Variables

## Brief Introduction: Understanding Variables in Algebra

In the world of mathematics, a **variable** is a symbol that stands for a number we don't know yet. It is called a variable because the value it represents can vary. This means the value of a variable can change. In algebra, we often use letters like `x`, `y`, or `z` to represent variables.

## Learning Objective: Learn What Variables Are and Their Importance in Algebra

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to understand what variables are, perform basic operations with variables, and solve simple algebraic expressions involving one variable.

### Task 1: Define a Variable and Understand Its Uses

A **variable** is a symbol, often a letter, that stands for a number. Variables are used in algebra to represent unknown numbers. If we have an equation like `x + 2 = 5`, `x` is a variable. We don't know what number `x` represents, but we know that whatever `x` is, if we add 2 to it, we get 5.

### Task 2: Perform Basic Operations with Variables

Just like with numbers, we can perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with variables. Here are some examples:

- Addition: `x + y` means we add the value of `x` to the value of `y`.
- Subtraction: `x - y` means we subtract the value of `y` from the value of `x`.
- Multiplication: `x * y` means we multiply the value of `x` by the value of `y`.
- Division: `x / y` means we divide the value of `x` by the value of `y`.

### Task 3: Solve Simple Algebraic Expressions Involving One Variable

Solving an algebraic expression means finding the value of the variable. Let's solve the equation `x + 2 = 5`:

1. To find the value of `x`, we need to get `x` alone on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation: `x + 2 - 2 = 5 - 2`.
2. This simplifies to `x = 3`.

So, the solution to the equation `x + 2 = 5` is `x = 3`. This means if we replace `x` with 3 in the original equation, both sides of the equation will be equal.

Remember, the value of a variable can change depending on the equation or problem we are trying to solve. That's why it's called a variable!
