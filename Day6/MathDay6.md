# Day 6: The Coordinate Plane

## Brief Introduction

Today, we will explore the world of the coordinate plane. This is a two-dimensional space where we can plot points, lines, and curves. It's like a map that mathematicians use to show the relationship between numbers.

## Learning Objective

By the end of this lesson, you should understand what a coordinate plane is, how to plot points on it, and how to identify the coordinates of a point on the graph.

## Task 1: Define the Coordinate Plane and Its Components

The **coordinate plane** is a two-dimensional surface formed by two number lines that intersect at right angles. These number lines are called **axes**. The horizontal axis is called the **x-axis**, and the vertical axis is called the **y-axis**. 

The point where the x-axis and y-axis intersect is called the **origin**. It is the point (0,0) on the coordinate plane.

The coordinate plane is divided into four sections called **quadrants**. They are numbered counterclockwise from the top right quadrant as Quadrant I, Quadrant II, Quadrant III, and Quadrant IV.

## Task 2: Plot Points Given in Coordinates

A point on the coordinate plane is represented by an ordered pair of numbers (x, y). The first number, x, is the **abscissa**, and it tells us how far to move left or right from the origin. The second number, y, is the **ordinate**, and it tells us how far to move up or down from the origin.

To plot a point, you start at the origin. Move along the x-axis to the value of x, then move parallel to the y-axis to the value of y. For example, to plot the point (3, 2), start at the origin, move 3 units to the right along the x-axis, and then move 2 units up.

## Task 3: Identify the Coordinates of a Point on the Graph

To find the coordinates of a point on the graph, you do the reverse of plotting a point. Start at the point, move horizontally to the x-axis and note the value. This is your x-coordinate. Then move vertically to the y-axis and note the value. This is your y-coordinate.

For example, if you have a point in Quadrant I, and you move 4 units to the left to reach the y-axis, your x-coordinate is 4. If you then move 3 units down to reach the x-axis, your y-coordinate is 3. So, the coordinates of the point are (4, 3).

Remember, the coordinate plane is a powerful tool in mathematics. It allows us to visualize and solve problems involving two variables. So, keep practicing plotting points and identifying coordinates. It will become second nature to you.
