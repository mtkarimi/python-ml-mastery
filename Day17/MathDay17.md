# Day 17: Measures of Central Tendency

## Introduction
In the world of data, we often want to find a single value that best describes a set of data points. This is where the measures of central tendency come into play. These measures include the mean, median, and mode. They help us understand the central position of a dataset.

## Learning Objective
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to calculate and interpret the mean, median, and mode of a dataset.

## Task 1: Calculate the Mean of a Dataset

The mean, often called the average, is calculated by adding all the numbers in the dataset and then dividing by the count of numbers in the dataset.

Here is an example:

Let's say we have a dataset: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.

To calculate the mean:

1. Add all the numbers: 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30
2. Count the numbers: There are 5 numbers in the dataset.
3. Divide the sum by the count: 30 รท 5 = 6

So, the mean of this dataset is 6.

## Task 2: Find the Median of a Dataset

The median is the middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending, dataset.

Here is an example:

Let's say we have a dataset: 1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9.

The dataset is already sorted, so we can see that the middle number is 6. So, the median of this dataset is 6.

If the dataset has an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.

For example, in the dataset: 1, 2, 3, 4, the median is (2 + 3) รท 2 = 2.5.

## Task 3: Determine the Mode of a Dataset

The mode is the number that appears most frequently in a dataset.

Here is an example:

Let's say we have a dataset: 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7.

The number 5 appears three times, more than any other number, so the mode of this dataset is 5.

A dataset may have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode at all.

## Conclusion

The mean, median, and mode are fundamental concepts in statistics and data analysis. They provide a way to summarize a dataset with a single value, representing a "typical" data point from the dataset. Understanding these measures will help you interpret and analyze data more effectively.
