# Day 4: Introduction to Geometry

## Brief Introduction

Geometry is a branch of mathematics that studies shapes, sizes, and properties of figures and spaces. It's like a game of drawing on paper, but with rules. In this lesson, we will learn about basic concepts in geometry, including shapes, angles, and how to measure them.

## Learning Objective

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

1. Identify different types of shapes and their properties.
2. Understand and measure angles.
3. Solve problems to find the perimeter of basic shapes.

## Task 1: Identify Different Types of Shapes and Their Properties

### Shapes

Shapes are the form of objects. In geometry, we have two main types of shapes: 2D (flat) and 3D (solid). 

#### 2D Shapes

These are flat shapes. They have only length and width. Examples include:

- **Circle**: A round shape with all points the same distance from the center.
- **Square**: A shape with four equal sides and four right angles.
- **Rectangle**: A shape with four sides and four right angles, but not all sides are equal.
- **Triangle**: A shape with three sides and three angles.

#### 3D Shapes

These are solid shapes. They have length, width, and height. Examples include:

- **Sphere**: A solid shape that is perfectly round, like a ball.
- **Cube**: A solid shape with six equal square faces.
- **Cylinder**: A solid shape with two flat circular faces and one curved face.
- **Cone**: A solid shape with a flat circular base and a pointed top.

## Task 2: Understand and Measure Angles

### Angles

An angle is formed when two lines meet at a point. The amount of turn between the two lines is the size of the angle. Angles are measured in degrees (°).

There are different types of angles:

- **Acute Angle**: An angle that is less than 90°.
- **Right Angle**: An angle that is exactly 90°.
- **Obtuse Angle**: An angle that is more than 90° but less than 180°.
- **Straight Angle**: An angle that is exactly 180°.

To measure an angle, we use a tool called a protractor.

## Task 3: Solve Problems to Find the Perimeter of Basic Shapes

### Perimeter

The perimeter is the distance around a shape. To find the perimeter of a shape, you add up the lengths of all its sides.

Here are some formulas for finding the perimeter of basic shapes:

- **Square**: Perimeter = 4 × side length
- **Rectangle**: Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)
- **Circle**: Perimeter (also called circumference) = 2π × radius
- **Triangle**: Perimeter = side1 + side2 + side3

Now, you can try to solve some problems to find the perimeter of these shapes.

Remember, geometry is like a game of drawing with rules. So, have fun with it!
