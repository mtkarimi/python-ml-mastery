# Day 4: Introduction to Optimization Methods

## Brief Introduction
Optimization is a process that involves finding the best solution from a set of possible solutions. It is a key concept in mathematics and computer science, used in areas like machine learning, data analysis, and operations research.

## Learning Objective
By the end of this lesson, you should be familiar with basic concepts in optimization, including objective functions, constraints, and different types of optimization methods.

## Task 1: Objective Functions and Constraints in Optimization Problems

### Objective Functions
An objective function, also known as a cost function or loss function, is a mathematical expression that we want to minimize or maximize in an optimization problem. For example, in a business setting, we might want to maximize profit or minimize cost.

Here's a simple example: Suppose we're selling lemonade, and we make $5 profit for each cup we sell. If we sell `x` cups, our profit (P) is `5x`. So, our objective function is `P(x) = 5x`, and we want to maximize this function.

### Constraints
Constraints are restrictions or limits on the possible solutions. In our lemonade example, we might have a constraint that we can't sell more than 100 cups of lemonade a day. This would be represented mathematically as `x ≤ 100`.

## Task 2: Linear and Nonlinear Optimization

### Linear Optimization
Linear optimization involves objective functions and constraints that are linear. In other words, all the terms are either constants or variables raised to the first power. Our lemonade example is a linear optimization problem.

### Nonlinear Optimization
Nonlinear optimization involves objective functions or constraints that are not linear. This could mean they involve variables raised to powers other than one, or they involve functions like sine, cosine, exponential, logarithmic, etc.

For example, suppose our profit for selling `x` cups of lemonade is `P(x) = 5x² - 10x + 3`. This is a nonlinear function, so this would be a nonlinear optimization problem.

## Task 3: Gradient Descent as an Optimization Method

Gradient descent is a method for finding the minimum of a function. It works by starting at a random point, calculating the gradient (or slope) of the function at that point, and then taking a step in the direction of steepest descent. This process is repeated until we reach a point where the gradient is zero, which is the minimum of the function.

Here's a simple example: Suppose we have a function `f(x) = x²`. The gradient of this function is `f'(x) = 2x`. If we start at `x = 3`, the gradient is `f'(3) = 6`. So, we take a step in the opposite direction (since we're minimizing), and our new `x` value is `3 - 6 = -3`. We repeat this process until we reach `x = 0`, which is the minimum of the function.

Remember, this is a very simplified example. In practice, we would use a smaller step size, and we would need to use more advanced techniques for functions with more than one variable.

That's it for today's lesson! You've learned about objective functions, constraints, linear and nonlinear optimization, and the gradient descent method. Keep practicing these concepts, and you'll become an optimization expert in no time!
