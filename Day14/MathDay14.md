# Day 14: The Pythagorean Theorem

## Brief Introduction

Today, we will explore the Pythagorean theorem, a fundamental principle in mathematics that describes the relationship between the sides of a right triangle. This theorem is a powerful tool that can help us find missing sides of right triangles, which is crucial in many areas of computer science, such as graphics, algorithms, and more.

## Learning Objective

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to apply the Pythagorean theorem to find missing sides of right triangles.

## Task 1: State the Pythagorean theorem

The Pythagorean theorem is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras. It states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This can be written as:

`a² + b² = c²`

where:
- `c` is the length of the hypotenuse,
- `a` and `b` are the lengths of the other two sides.

## Task 2: Solve for the hypotenuse of a right triangle

To find the length of the hypotenuse `c` of a right triangle, you can rearrange the Pythagorean theorem as follows:

`c = sqrt(a² + b²)`

Let's say we have a right triangle with sides `a = 3` and `b = 4`. We can find the length of the hypotenuse `c` by plugging these values into the formula:

`c = sqrt(3² + 4²) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5`

So, the length of the hypotenuse `c` is `5`.

## Task 3: Find the missing leg of a right triangle

If you know the lengths of the hypotenuse `c` and one of the legs `a` or `b`, you can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the missing leg. The formula can be rearranged as follows:

`a = sqrt(c² - b²)` or `b = sqrt(c² - a²)`

For example, if we know that `c = 5` and `a = 3`, we can find `b` by plugging these values into the formula:

`b = sqrt(5² - 3²) = sqrt(25 - 9) = sqrt(16) = 4`

So, the length of the missing leg `b` is `4`.

Remember, the Pythagorean theorem only applies to right triangles. If you're dealing with a triangle that is not a right triangle, you'll need to use other methods to find missing side lengths.
