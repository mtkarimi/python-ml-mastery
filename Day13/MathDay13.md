# Basic Trigonometry

## Introduction
Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with the relationships between the sides and angles of triangles. This tutorial will introduce you to the basic concepts of trigonometry using right triangles.

## Learning Objective
By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to understand and use basic trigonometric ratios to solve problems.

## Task 1: Define sine, cosine, and tangent using right triangles

In a right triangle, the side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse. The other two sides are called the adjacent and opposite sides, based on their relation to an angle in the triangle.

The basic trigonometric ratios are defined as follows:

1. **Sine (sin)**: The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In other words, `sin(angle) = opposite/hypotenuse`.

2. **Cosine (cos)**: The cosine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse. That is, `cos(angle) = adjacent/hypotenuse`.

3. **Tangent (tan)**: The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the sine to the cosine, or the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. So, `tan(angle) = sin(angle)/cos(angle) = opposite/adjacent`.

## Task 2: Calculate the sides of a right triangle using trigonometric ratios

To calculate the sides of a right triangle using trigonometric ratios, you can use the definitions of sine, cosine, and tangent. Here's how:

1. If you know an angle and the length of the hypotenuse, you can calculate the length of the opposite side using the sine ratio: `opposite = hypotenuse * sin(angle)`. Similarly, you can calculate the length of the adjacent side using the cosine ratio: `adjacent = hypotenuse * cos(angle)`.

2. If you know an angle and the length of the opposite side, you can calculate the length of the hypotenuse using the sine ratio: `hypotenuse = opposite / sin(angle)`. Similarly, you can calculate the length of the adjacent side using the tangent ratio: `adjacent = opposite / tan(angle)`.

3. If you know an angle and the length of the adjacent side, you can calculate the length of the hypotenuse using the cosine ratio: `hypotenuse = adjacent / cos(angle)`. Similarly, you can calculate the length of the opposite side using the tangent ratio: `opposite = adjacent * tan(angle)`.

## Task 3: Solve real-world problems using basic trigonometry

Trigonometry is not just about triangles. It has many real-world applications. For example, you can use trigonometry to calculate the height of a tree, the distance between two points, the angle of elevation or depression, and so on.

Here's a simple example: Suppose you are standing 20 meters away from a tree and the angle of elevation to the top of the tree is 30 degrees. You can calculate the height of the tree using the tangent ratio: `height = distance * tan(angle) = 20 * tan(30) = 20 * 0.577 = 11.54 meters`.

Remember, practice is key to mastering trigonometry. Try to solve as many problems as you can, and don't hesitate to ask for help if you get stuck. Happy learning!
