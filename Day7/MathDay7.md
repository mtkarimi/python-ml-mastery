# Day 7: Functions and Relations

## Brief Introduction
In the world of algebra, functions play a very important role. They are like machines that take in a number, do something to it, and then give out another number. Today, we will learn about these functions and how they are different from relations.

## Learning Objective
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to understand the concept of functions, differentiate them from relations, apply the vertical line test, and plot simple functions on a graph.

## Task 1: Define a Function and Differentiate it from a Relation

A **function** is a special type of relation where each input (or 'x' value) is related to exactly one output (or 'y' value). You can think of it as a rule that assigns each input to one and only one output. For example, a function could be as simple as adding 2 to every number you input.

A **relation**, on the other hand, is a set of ordered pairs. It can have one input related to more than one output. For example, a relation could be that every child in a family has the same parents. Here, each child (input) is related to two parents (outputs).

The main difference between a function and a relation is that a function has a unique output for each input, while a relation can have multiple outputs for the same input.

## Task 2: Understand and Apply the Vertical Line Test

The **vertical line test** is a simple way to check if a graph represents a function or not. Here's how it works:

1. Draw a vertical line anywhere on the graph.
2. If the line crosses the graph at more than one point, then the graph does not represent a function.
3. If the line crosses the graph at only one point, no matter where you draw it, then the graph does represent a function.

This test works because, in a function, each 'x' value (or input) can only have one 'y' value (or output). So, a vertical line (which represents a single 'x' value) should only cross the graph at one point (a single 'y' value).

## Task 3: Plot Simple Functions on a Graph

Plotting functions on a graph is a great way to visualize them. Here's how you can do it:

1. Write down the function rule. For example, the function could be `y = x + 2`.
2. Choose some 'x' values and calculate the corresponding 'y' values using the function rule.
3. Plot these points (x, y) on the graph.
4. Draw a line or curve through the points.

Remember, when you plot a function, every 'x' value should have exactly one 'y' value. If you apply the vertical line test to your graph and it passes, you've plotted the function correctly!

In the next lesson, we will learn more about different types of functions and how to work with them. Keep practicing and happy learning!
