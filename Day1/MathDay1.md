# Introduction to Numbers

## Brief Introduction: Basics of Numbers and Operations

Numbers are the building blocks of mathematics. They help us count, measure, and label. There are different types of numbers, each with its own properties. In this lesson, we will learn about whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, and irrational numbers. We will also learn how to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Learning Objective: Understand Different Types of Numbers and Basic Operations

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

1. Identify and classify numbers as whole, integer, rational, or irrational.
2. Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with whole numbers.
3. Solve word problems using basic arithmetic operations.

## Task 1: Identify and Classify Numbers

### Whole Numbers

Whole numbers are all the numbers that you can count on your fingers, starting from zero. They include 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on.

### Integers

Integers are like whole numbers, but they also include negative numbers. So, in addition to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on, integers also include -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, and so on.

### Rational Numbers

Rational numbers are numbers that can be written as a fraction, where both the numerator (the top number) and the denominator (the bottom number) are integers. For example, 1/2, 3/4, and -5/7 are all rational numbers.

### Irrational Numbers

Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be written as a fraction. They are numbers that, when written as a decimal, go on forever without repeating. For example, the number pi (approximately 3.14159) is an irrational number.

## Task 2: Perform Basic Arithmetic Operations

### Addition

Addition is the process of putting things together. For example, if you have 2 apples and you add 3 more apples, you will have 5 apples in total.

### Subtraction

Subtraction is the process of taking things away. For example, if you have 5 apples and you eat 2 apples, you will have 3 apples left.

### Multiplication

Multiplication is a shortcut for addition. For example, if you have 3 bags of apples and each bag has 2 apples, you have 3 * 2 = 6 apples in total.

### Division

Division is the process of splitting things into equal parts. For example, if you have 6 apples and you want to share them equally among 3 friends, each friend will get 6 / 3 = 2 apples.

## Task 3: Solve Word Problems Using Basic Arithmetic Operations

Let's solve a word problem together:

Problem: John has 3 apples. His friend gives him 2 more apples. How many apples does John have now?

Solution: This is an addition problem. John starts with 3 apples and gets 2 more. So, we add 3 + 2 to find the total number of apples John has. The answer is 5 apples.

Remember, practice makes perfect. Try to solve more word problems using these basic arithmetic operations.
