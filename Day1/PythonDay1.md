# Day 1: Getting Started with Python

## Brief Introduction

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It is designed with a philosophy that emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. This philosophy is encapsulated in the document "PEP 20 - The Zen of Python", which outlines 19 guiding principles for writing computer programs that are a model of Python's design.

Python is versatile and powerful, making it suitable for a variety of applications. Today, it is widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and scientific computing, among other areas.

## Learning Objective

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to understand what Python is, its history, and its main uses today. You should also be able to set up a Python development environment on your machine and write and execute a basic Python script.

## Task 1: Research Python's History, Design Philosophy, and Main Uses Today

Python's history begins with its creator, Guido van Rossum, who started working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC language. Python 2.0 was released in 2000, and Python 3.0, which is not backward-compatible, was released in 2008.

The design philosophy of Python is encapsulated in "PEP 20 - The Zen of Python", which includes principles like "Beautiful is better than ugly", "Explicit is better than implicit", and "Simple is better than complex".

Python is used in a variety of applications today, including:

- Web and Internet Development: Python offers frameworks for web development like Django and Pyramid.
- Scientific and Numeric Computing: Python is widely used in scientific and mathematical computing via libraries like SciPy, Pandas, and IPython.
- Education: Python is a great language for teaching programming, both at the introductory level and in more advanced courses.
- Desktop GUIs: Python provides libraries to create graphical user interfaces like Tkinter and wxPython.
- Software Development: Python is often used as a support language for software developers, for build control and management, testing, and more.

## Task 2: Install Python on Your Machine

To install Python on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Visit the official Python website at https://www.python.org/.
2. Navigate to the Downloads section and click on the button that corresponds to your operating system (Windows, MacOS, or Linux/UNIX).
3. Run the downloaded file and follow the instructions to install Python.

To verify the installation, open your terminal and type `python --version`. You should see the version of Python that you installed displayed.

## Task 3: Write and Execute a Basic Python Script

To write and execute a basic Python script, follow these steps:

1. Open your IDE or text editor of choice.
2. Create a new file and save it as `hello_world.py`.
3. In this file, write the following code: `print("Hello, World!")`.
4. Save the file and run it in your terminal by navigating to the directory where you saved the file and typing `python hello_world.py`.

You should see the text "Hello, World!" printed to your console. Congratulations, you have just written and executed your first Python script!
