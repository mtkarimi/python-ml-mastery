# Day 22: Exploring PyTorch Ecosystem and Libraries

PyTorch is not just a deep learning library, it's an ecosystem that includes a variety of tools and libraries that extend its functionalities. These libraries are designed to help with different tasks such as text processing, image processing, model optimization, etc. In this tutorial, we will explore one of these libraries and implement a small project using it.

## Task 1: Select a library from the PyTorch ecosystem

For this tutorial, we will use the `TorchVision` library. `TorchVision` is a part of the PyTorch project that provides tools and resources for working with image data. It includes datasets, model architectures, and image transformation tools.

```python
import torchvision
```

## Task 2: Implement a small project using TorchVision

Let's implement a simple image classification task using the CIFAR10 dataset provided by `TorchVision`.

First, we need to import the necessary libraries and load the dataset.

```python
import torch
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

transform = transforms.Compose(
    [transforms.ToTensor(),
     transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))])

trainset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True,
                                        download=True, transform=transform)
trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=4,
                                          shuffle=True, num_workers=2)

testset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=False,
                                       download=True, transform=transform)
testloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(testset, batch_size=4,
                                         shuffle=False, num_workers=2)

classes = ('plane', 'car', 'bird', 'cat',
           'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck')
```

Next, we define a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) and train it on the dataset.

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, 120)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 5 * 5)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

net = Net()
```

## Task 3: Evaluate how the library facilitates your development work

`TorchVision` greatly simplifies the process of working with image data in PyTorch. It provides preprocessed datasets and pre-trained models, which can save a lot of time and computational resources. The image transformation tools make it easy to perform common preprocessing tasks. Overall, `TorchVision` is a powerful tool that can significantly speed up the development of image-based machine learning projects.
